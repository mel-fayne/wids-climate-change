        "    - Pressure-Driven Circulation: Sea level pressure is a key factor in driving large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the Hadley cell and the polar cell. These patterns can affect temperature by transporting warm air from equatorial regions to the poles, and cold air from the poles to the equator.\n",
        "    - Latitude-Dependent Pressure Patterns: Sea level pressure is also affected by latitude, with lower pressure near the equator and higher pressure near the poles.

Conversely, air that is compressed by a decrease in pressure will experience an increase in temperature.\n",
        "    - Gas Law Relationships: The relationship between air pressure and temperature is described by the gas laws, such as Boyle's Law and Charles's Law.

        "- Precipitation is any form of water, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail, that falls from the atmosphere to the surface of the Earth.\n",
        "- Precipitable water is a measure of the amount of water vapor present in a vertical column of the atmosphere, from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. It is expressed in units of millimeters (mm) or centimeters (cm) and represents the amount of water that would fall to the ground as precipitation if all the water vapor in the column were to condense.\n",
        "- Precipitation occurs when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into clouds, and then falls to the ground due to the force of gravity. \n",
        "- Precipitation can have both direct and indirect effects on temperature:\n",
        "    - Direct effect: Precipitation itself can cause a change in temperature. For example, when rain falls, it can bring cooler air down with it, causing a drop in temperature. On the other hand, snow can reflect sunlight, which can help to keep temperatures cooler, especially in the winter.\n",
        "    - Indirect effect: Precipitation can also affect temperature by altering the amount of solar radiation that reaches the surface of the Earth. For example, if there is a lot of cloud cover associated with a precipitation event, this can reduce the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ground, leading to cooler temperatures. Similarly, if there is less cloud cover, more solar radiation can reach the surface, causing temperatures to warm.\n",

        "    - Insolation: At higher elevations, there is less atmospheric absorption of incoming solar radiation, which results in more insolation (solar radiation) reaching the surface. This can lead to increased surface temperature at higher elevations.\n",

        "- Sea ice concentration refers to the amount of sea ice present in a particular region, usually expressed as a percentage of the total area covered by sea ice. In meteorology, sea ice concentration is an important factor that affects temperature.\n",
        "- Sea ice concentration affects temperature in several ways:\n",
        "    - Albedo effect: Sea ice reflects a significant portion of incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere, which can result in cooling of the surface and atmosphere.\n",
        "    - Heat exchange: The presence of sea ice can reduce heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, which can affect temperature.\n",
        "    - Latent heat: The formation and melting of sea ice can release and absorb latent heat, which can affect temperature by releasing or absorbing energy into the atmosphere.\n",
        "    - Insolation: The presence of sea ice can also affect insolation (incoming solar radiation) by reducing the amount of radiation that reaches the surface.\n",

        "    - \"TMP2m\" typically refers to the \"2-meter temperature,\" which is a measurement of the air temperature at a height of 2 meters above the surface of the Earth. \n",
        "    - This is a standard measurement used in meteorology and climatology to describe the temperature conditions of the lower atmosphere. \n",
        "    - The temperature at 2 meters is a commonly used variable for both observational and modeling purposes\n",
        "    - This is because it is a good indicator of near-surface temperature conditions that can impact human activities, such as agriculture and transportation.\n",
        "    - In this competition the target refers to the to the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum temperature over the next 14 days, for each location and start date.\n",
        "    - Makes this a continous regression problem.\n",
